!import-table --DimensionalClash --hide
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Astral Tear. Both items destroyed and all contents are sucked into the Astral Plane, forever lost. --8 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Astral Rift. Both items destroyed and everything within a 10-foot radius sucked into the Astral Plane. --8 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Astral Burst. Both items destroyed and contents violently ejected, pelting everything in a 10-foot radius. Treat all contents as projectile weapons and roll for breakage. --8 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Astral Breach. Not only is there an explosion, but some entity usually only encountered on the astral plane has been sucked through as well. It is not likely to be pleased. --8 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Stable Juxtaposition. Both extradimensional apertures and spaces function normally. --24 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Unstable Juxtaposition. Both extradimensional apertures cease function. --10 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Outer stability, inner instability. The outer item functions normally but the inner item does not function until removed from the outer. --10 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Outer instability, inner stability. The inner item functions normally but the outer item does not function until the inner is removed or otherwise disabled. --10 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Inward Merge. Outer item destroyed but contents and capacity of outer item added to space of inner item. Inner item continues to function. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Outward Merge. Inner item destroyed but contents and capacity of inner item added to outer item. Outer item continues to function. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Aperture Swap. There is a violent twist of the dimensional warp. Once settled, the aperture of the first item leads to the former interior of the second and vice versa. This can lead to oddities such as extremely capacious quivers with invisible valets or magnificent mansion doors that lead to sporting goods closets. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Enchantment Transference. The enchantments and extradimensional pockets detach from their related items but reattach to the nearest examples of similar objects not already enchanted. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Maw of the Devourer. Both items appear to function normally, but the dimensional warps have attracted the attention of an astral devourer which replaces the apertures with its own orifices. When next opened, original contents will be lost and both will operate as Bags of Devouring. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Dyspepsia of the Devourer. An astral devourer has discovered the dimensional warps but finds their undulations extremely unappetizing. It vomits the contents of one of its orifices into both. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Negative Transmutation. The magical field wavers and valuable contents are transmuted to valueless analogues: gold becomes lead, gems become glass, and all items are stripped of their magic. What happens to living flesh is anyoneâ€™s guess. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Positive Transmutation. The magical field wavers and mundane contents are transmuted to precious analogues: lead becomes gold, glass becomes gems, and mundane articles become magical. What happens to living flesh is likewise a mystery. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Pinhole. Both items appear to function normally, but there is a slight tear in space and a random object within one is lost to the Astral plane. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Astral Packrat. Both items appear to function normally, but the dimensional instability has drawn the attention of some astral entity which takes something from either space but leaves something else in it in exchange. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Flotsam of the Astral Seas. Some item lost ages ago in the Astral Plane, never to be seen again, suddenly is<%%-%%>in the bottom of one of the extradimensional spaces. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Wormhole. Both items now lead to the same extradimensional space, with the capacity and contents of both. --1 --
!import-table-item --DimensionalClash --Well of Many Worlds. One of the items becomes a Well of Many Worlds, casting the other and the rest of its contents into another world. The lost possessions may be retrieved by those who dare to journey through the aperture of the first item. --1 --

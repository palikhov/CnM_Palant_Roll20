!import-table-item --Minor-Magic-Items --Colorthief's Brush. This paintbrush has a needle on the back. If you prick something, you steal all the color from it, but can later paint with those same brilliant colors (stored in the brush, controlled by imagination).

On the upside, you are immune to the beauty of nymphs and the ugliness of catoblepas. --1 --
!import-table-item --Minor-Magic-Items --Vial of Nightshade. When drunk, it puts the body into a deep coma and ejects the spirit. You can now roam around, incorporeal, until you return to your body.
